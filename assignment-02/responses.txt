How are VCS useful?
For collaberative projects, it's good to for everyone that is part of the team to be able to have easy access to the project files.

Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?
I like to use adobe suite and clip studio, because they're super versatile, easy to use and help make really clean-looking work.
