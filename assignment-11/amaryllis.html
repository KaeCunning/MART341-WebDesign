            <strong> The Amaryllis Flower is a plant with heavy seeds</strong> that do not travel far, so they frequently are seen in 
            very dense concentrations in the wild. They tend to grow after <span class=red>bushfires</span>, as they are frequently suppressed in areas of taller plants.

            This plant has a symiotic relationship with carpenter bees and noctuid moths in the wild. In horticulture, they 
            have been cultivated into an especially large and vivid flower called the <em>Amaryllis belladonna.</em>
