        <p><strong>More commonly know as <span class="red">"Indian paintbrush"</span> or <span class="red">"prairie-fire"</span>,</strong>
            castilleja is a native species to western north America that thrives in mountain valleys. 
            It is a hemiparisitc plant that relies on surrounding grasses for nuetrients.

            The <span class=red>bright-red color</span> does not come from petals, but are actually <em>bracts</em> (specialized leaf-like structures). 
            They are named after the Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo, but the colloquial term <span class=red>"paintbrush"</span> comes 
            from these bracts, as the look like they have been carefully dipped with paint on their tips.
