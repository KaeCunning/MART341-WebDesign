            <strong>The Licoris is a flowering plant</strong> that is commonly know as a <span class="red">Spider Lily</span>. Wild varieties of this flower can bear fruit,
            but these, including most of the rest of the plant, are very poisonous to humans. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Perhaps due to there poisonous nature combined with their fragrant, vivid beauty, it is strongly associated with themes of <span class="red">death and final farewells. </span>
