What is the difference between padding, margin, and borders?

They are each different layers placed around a piece of content. Padding is the closest layer to the content, the border is second, the margin is furthest. They each have different ways of interacting with a web page. For example, you can change the border color and style specifically, but the padding will be whatever background layer you have on the content; it is an extension of the content, rather than a seperate thing like the border is. They all effect content layout in different ways.

Optional: how did this week's assignment go? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?

The drop-down menu gave me trouble for a second, but I figured it out. I'm a little confused on the min-width function, I feel like sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. That might have to do with my selector order of importance thing though.
