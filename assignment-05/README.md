Website from the Wayback Machine;
spacejam.com
year: 1996
The design of the old website uses that pale yellow and bright red typing color that's really common on old blogs and other sites. The links direct you to the warner brothers website still, so that hasn't change since then. The background is giving "arcade carpet" vibes. There is a revamped version of the website when the new space jam came out in 2021, which has the same setup, but with fancier animations and links that make more sense for modern times, like shop options and social media outlets.
