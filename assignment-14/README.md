How did your user testing sessions go?

it went alright, I haven't put much content into the site yet, because I don't want to have to redo a bunch of things if I need to tweak things. It does make it very incomplete, though, which is
what my testers noticed the most..

What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?

I did not have them test this early this week so I haven't tweaked much since. I'll try to fix the cog animation first.

Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?

The cogwheel animation has given me a bit of trouble, because I made it more complicated than it had to be I think. I'm trying to find a way to make an animation div that incapsulates all the cog and image elements, but the animation messes up when I do. I also noticed all the elements show up smaller on the git hub live site as compared to my vscode live site, which is odd.
